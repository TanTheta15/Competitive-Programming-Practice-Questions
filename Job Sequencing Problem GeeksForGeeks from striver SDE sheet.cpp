/*    Job Sequencing Problem
Given a set of N jobs where each jobi has a deadline and profit associated with it.

Each job takes 1 unit of time to complete and only one job can be scheduled at a time. We earn the profit associated with job if and only if the job is completed by its deadline.

Find the number of jobs done and the maximum profit.

Note: Jobs will be given in the form (Jobid, Deadline, Profit) associated with that Job.


Example 1:

Input:
N = 4
Jobs = {(1,4,20),(2,1,10),(3,1,40),(4,1,30)}
Output:
2 60
Explanation:
Job1 and Job3 can be done with
maximum profit of 60 (20+40).
